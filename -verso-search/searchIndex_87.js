It presents an abstract definition of stochastic iterative optimization algorithms along with a construction of probability measures on the space of the iterations of the algorithm. This documentation describes the L∃∀N formalization of this framework. To illustrate the framework, we also present the formalization of two algorithms: Pure Random Search and LIPO . To see a more complete example of the use of the framework, see the formalization of Proposition 1 of Malherbe and Vayatis (2017)¹.\n\n\n\n\n\n","context":"","header":"Formalization of stochastic iterative optimization algorithm","id":"/#Formalization-of-stochastic-iterative-optimization-algorithm"}});
