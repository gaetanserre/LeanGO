It uses the Lipschitz constant to adaptively construct an upper bound that guides the sampling of the search space. More formally, at each iteration, LIPO samples uniformly from the set of potential maximizers defined as\n\n\\left \\{ x \\in \\alpha \\; \\middle| \\; \\max_{1 \\le i \\le n} f(X_i) \\le \\min_{1 \\le i \\le n} f(X_i) + \\kappa \\|X_i - x \\|_2 \\right\\},\n\nwhere \\alpha is a measurable subset of \\mathbb{R}^d with finite and non-zero measure and \\kappa is the Lipschitz constant of the function f : \\alpha \\to \\mathbb{R}.\n\n \n\nIt can be represented in our framework as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n","context":"Formalization of stochastic iterative optimization algorithm\u0009Some examples","header":"2.2.
